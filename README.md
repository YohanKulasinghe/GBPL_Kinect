# GBPL_Kinect

This repository contains skeleton abnormality detection system using Microsoft Kinect v2 device. C#

This System only provides skeleton coordinates and if Kinect reads a value outside the given range it shows as an abnormality. 

More optimization and correction needs to get an accurate result.
